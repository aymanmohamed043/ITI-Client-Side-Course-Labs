# ITI-Client-Side-Course-Labs
## 🌐 Frontend Labs Repository

This repository contains my practice work in **Frontend Development**.  
It is divided into two main sections:  

- **HTML & CSS Labs** → Practicing layouts, styling, and responsive design.  
- **JavaScript Labs** → Building interactivity, logic, and dynamic pages.  

The goal is to strengthen my frontend skills through structured exercises.
